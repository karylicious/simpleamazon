					<h3>Pilots strike at cargo airline serving Amazon, DHL as holidays near</h3>
					<p>Pilots at ABX Air, an express cargo airline that serves online retailer Amazon.com Inc and DHL Express, went on strike on Tuesday, a critical time for retailers with the holiday shopping season about to kick into high gear.</p>
					<p>Some 250 pilots, who are represented by the Teamsters union, went on strike in the early morning, affecting around 75 flights, mostly for Amazon and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post AG.</p>
					<p>Pilots went on strike because ABX, owned by Air Transport Services Group Inc, has violated its contract by asking them to work emergency hours over the last two years because of a staffing shortage, then failed to grant them compensatory time off or allow pilots to take earned vacations, the union said.</p>

				<h2>Judge orders Amazon refunds for children's in-app purchases</h2>
				<p>A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout.</p>

					<h3>Judge orders Amazon refunds for children's in-app purchases</h3>
					<p>A federal judge on Thursday directed Amazon.com Inc to set up a year-long process to reimburse parents whose children made in-app purchases without permission, but rejected a U.S. regulator's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout.</p>
					<p>U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, issued his order more than six months after finding the online retailer liable, in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
					<p>The FTC in July 2014 accused Amazon of making it too easy for children to run up bills while playing games such as "Pet Shop Story" and "Ice Age Village" on mobile devices, resulting in an estimated $86 million of unauthorized charges.</p>
					<p>Thursday's order calls for Amazon to set up a notice-and-claims process beginning in early 2017 to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, and then to reimburse them.</p>
					<p>Coughenour said this approach "removes the uncertainty of the proper lump sum amount that the parties have vigorously disputed. Moreover, it accomplishes the goals of placing liability on Amazon and refunding eligible customers."</p>
					<p>Coughenour called the FTC's $26.5 million damages request "too high," agreeing with Amazon that it might have taken into account failed password attempts unrelated to unauthorized purchases by children.</p>
					<p>But the judge rejected Amazon's request to issue refunds in the form of gift cards, saying the company would "undoubtedly recapture some of the profits that are at issue."</p>
					<p>Neither Amazon nor the FTC immediately responded to requests for comment.</p>
					<p>The FTC in 2014 settled similar cases against Apple Inc and Google Inc, now part of Alphabet Inc, with Apple agreeing to refund at least $32.5 million and Google at least $19 million.</p>
					<p>All three companies have improved their password and other controls to help thwart unauthorized charges.</p>
